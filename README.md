Lab Assignment1

Task 1
You will need to solve a relaxed version of the NYC instance where we do not have the energy constraint. You can use any algorithm we discussed in the lectures. Note that this is equivalent to solving the shortest path problem. (30 marks)

Task 2
You will need to implement an uninformed search algorithm (e.g., the DFS,
BFS, UCS) to solve the NYC instance. (30 marks)

Task 3
You will need to develop an A* search algorithm to solve the NYC instance. The key is to develop a suitable heuristic function for the A* search algorithm in this setting. (40 marks)
